Surface tension is what allows heavier than water i.e., denser than water \r\n                  objects such as razor blades, insects (e.g. water striders), to float and slide on a water surface without \r\n                  becoming even partly submerged.\r\n                </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                </Zoom>\r\n            </section>\r\n\r\n            <section class=\"slanted-div1\">\r\n                <Zoom><div>\r\n                <h1 className=\"slanted-div-1\">Causes of Surface Tension</h1>\r\n              <p className=\"slanted-div-1\">Due to the cohesive forces a molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighbouring liquid molecules, \r\n                  resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface do not have the same molecules on all sides of them \r\n                  and therefore are pulled inward. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the \r\n                  minimum area. <br/><br/>\r\n                  There is also a tension parallel to the surface at the liquid-air interface which will resist an external \r\n                  force, due to the cohesive nature of water molecules.\r\n                </p>\r\n                </div></Zoom>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <section class=\"slanted-div\">\r\n                <Zoom>\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1>Effects of Surface Tension</h1>\r\n              <p>Several effects of surface tension can be seen with ordinary water: <br/><br/>\r\n             <span>1.</span> \r\n              Beading of rain water on a waxy surface, such as a leaf.

It then separates and surface tension forms the drop into a sphere. If a stream of water \r\n              were running from the faucet, the stream would break up into drops during its fall. Gravity stretches the stream, then \r\n              surface tension pinches it into spheres.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"beading-leaf\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/pop.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443559966-gettyimages-534581737.jpg\" />\r\n                </div>\r\n                </Zoom>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <section class=\"slanted-div\">\r\n               <Zoom>\r\n               <div>\r\n                <h1>Effects of Surface Tension</h1>\r\n              <p><span>3.</span>Flotation of objects denser than water occurs when the object is nonwettable and its weight is \r\n              small enough to be borne by the forces arising from surface tension. For example, water striders use surface tension \r\n              to walk on the surface of a pond in the following way. The nonwettability of the water strider's leg means there is no \r\n              attraction between molecules of the leg and molecules of the water, so when the leg pushes down on the water, the surface\r\n               tension of the water only tries to recover its flatness from its deformation due to the leg. This behavior of the water \r\n               pushes the water strider upward so it can stand on the surface of the water as long as its mass is small enough that\r\n                the water can support it. The surface of the water behaves like an elastic film: the insect's feet cause indentations\r\n                 in the water's surface, increasing its surface area and tendency of minimization of surface curvature (so area) \r\n                 of the water pushes the insect's feet upward.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img className=\"beading-leaf\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-466bc9be9b96c716c662c64cc5e1eb79\" />\r\n                </div>\r\n               </Zoom>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <section class=\"slanted-div1\">\r\n                <Zoom>\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 className=\"slanted-div-1\">Physical Unit of Surface Tension</h1>\r\n              <p className=\"slanted-div-1\">\r\n              Surface tension, represented by the symbol γ (alternatively σ or T), is measured in force per unit length.
